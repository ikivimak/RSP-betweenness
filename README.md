This repo contains code for computing the Randomized Shortest Paths betweenness centralities of a network, based on

Kivimäki, Ilkka, et al. "Two betweenness centrality measures based on Randomized Shortest Paths." arXiv preprint arXiv:1509.03147 (2015).

and the data used within that paper. In addition, osm2nx.py can be used to parse OpenStreetMap geodata into Networkx and has been used to generate lowermanhattan.mat.
